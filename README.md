# cockpitDIYweb
## This webproject which associated to a leanstartup project call "Cockpit DIY"

The cockpit DIY website is used to attract attention and gain early feedback for a business project. The project could benefit from gathering earlier input and evaluating the feasibility business idea. However, the Lean-start-up is no guarantee of 100% accuracy of its prediction/evaluation.

I had developed the website under the Django environment with Python. I had designed the front-end of the website with HTML and CSS. The backend is running on a Ubuntu 18(Linux) Virtual Machine on an AWS cloud server. So this is a full-stack web project that includes setting the server environment, building a SQL server, configuring a security feature for the website, etc.
